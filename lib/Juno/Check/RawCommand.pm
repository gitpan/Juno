=head1 NAME

Juno::Check::RawCommand - A raw command check for Juno

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows you to run a raw command. The command will be run in a separate fork
using L<System::Command> so you can get full access to everything in the
command (stdout, stderr, exit code, etc.).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 cmd

The command to run. This allows a B<very> simple template that allows you to
use C<%h> as the host.

=head2 hosts

An arrayref of hosts to check, overriding the default given to Juno.pm.

    my $juno = Juno->new(
        checks => {
            RawCommand => {
                hosts      => ['Jeff'],
                cmd        => 'grep %h %h.log', # %h will be the host
                on_success => sub {
                    my ( $check, $host, $cmd ) = @_;

                    print "Found $host in $host.log\n"
                        . $cmd->{'stdout'};
                },

                on_fail    => sub {
                    my ( $check, $host, $cmd, $msg ) = @_;

                    $msg and print "Deserialization failed, odd error: $msg\n";

                    print "Failed to find $host in log.txt:\n"
                        . $cmd->{'stderr'};
                },
            },
        },
    );

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 interval

An integer of seconds between each check (nor per-host).

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_success

A coderef to run when making a successful result, which is zero by default.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_fail

A coderef to run when making an unsuccessful request, which isn't zero by
default.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_result

A coderef to run on the result. This is what you use
in case you want more control over what's going on.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_before

A coderef to run before running the command.

=head2 watcher

Holds the watcher for the command check timer.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.
