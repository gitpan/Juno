=head1 NAME

Juno::Check::FPing - An FPing check for Juno

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 hosts

An arrayref of hosts to check, overriding the default given to Juno.pm.

    my $juno = Juno->new(
        hosts  => [ 'Tom', 'Jerry' ],
        checks => {
            FPing => {
                hosts => [ 'Micky', 'Mini' ], # this overrides tom and jerry
            },
        },
    );

Now the FPing check will not check Tom and Jerry, but rather Micky and Mini.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 interval

An integer of seconds between each check (nor per-host).

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_success

A coderef to run when making a successful request.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_fail

A coderef to run when making an unsuccessful request.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_result

A coderef to run when getting a response - any response. This is what you use
in case you want more control over what's going on.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_before

A coderef to run before making a request.

=head2 watcher

Holds the watcher for the FPing check timer.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 analyze_fping(TIMING)

Analyzes the fping results, returns timing, packet loss and average.

=head2 check

L<Juno> will call this method for you. You should not call it yourself.

=head2 run

L<Juno> will call this method for you. You should not call it yourself.
