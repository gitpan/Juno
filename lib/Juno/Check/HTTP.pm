=head1 NAME

Juno::Check::HTTP - An HTTP check for Juno

=head1 VERSION

version 0.009

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    my $juno = Juno->new(
        checks => {
            HTTP => {
                hosts => [ 'tom', 'jerry' ],
                path  => '/my/custom/path',
            },
        }
    );

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 path

The path that is checked.

Default: B</>.

=head2 headers

A hashref or additional headers to send to the server. This is useful if you
want to run a request to a server requesting a specific website
(i.e., VirtualHost).

=head2 hosts

An arrayref of hosts to check, overriding the default given to Juno.pm.

    my $juno = Juno->new(
        hosts  => [ 'Tom', 'Jerry' ],
        checks => {
            HTTP => {
                hosts => [ 'Micky', 'Mini' ], # this overrides tom and jerry
            },
        },
    );

Now the HTTP check will not check Tom and Jerry, but rather Micky and Mini.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 interval

An integer of seconds between each check (nor per-host).

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_success

A coderef to run when making a successful request. This is done by checking the
HTTP response header has a status code starting with 200 (which is by HTTP RFC
a successful response).

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_fail

A coderef to run when making an unsuccessful request. This is the opposite of
C<on_success> described above.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_result

A coderef to run when getting a response - any response. This is what you use
in case you want more control over what's going on.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.

=head2 on_before

A coderef to run before making a request. A useful example of this is timing
the request.

    use Juno;
    use AnyEvent;

    my $cv   = AnyEvent->condvar;
    my %time = (
        tom => AnyEvent->now,
    );

    my $juno = Juno->new(
        checks => {
            HTTP => {
                on_before => sub {
                    my $host = $_[1];
                    $time{$host} = AnyEvent->now;
                },

                on_result => sub {
                    my $host = $_[1];
                    my $time = AnyEvent->now - $time{'tom'};
                    print "It took $time to run the request to $host\n";
                },
            },
        },
    );

=head2 watcher

Holds the watcher for the HTTP check timer.

This attribute derives from L<Juno::Role::Check>.
